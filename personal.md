When I'm not teaching, playing and conducting, I am a keen sportsman and enjoy playing badminton 
competitively as well as more occasional forays onto the squash and tennis courts. I also excel as an 
armchair fan of most sports, knowing far more than I should about the obscurities of darts, snooker, 
tennis, football (soccer) and athletics. I have at times enjoyed running but my most recent discovery 
is cycling and I try to commute pretty much everywhere on two wheels, come rain or shine. The flipside 
to my sporting endeavors is a passion for eating and drinking, and general Yorkshire pride. I can (and will)
 talk endlessly about the unique qualities of a "proper" pint of beer (which should be large, British, flat,
  with a proper head, and preferably from God's country√â.Yorkshire obviously) and enjoy getting ambitious in 
  the kitchen. My time in America has left me with a particular affinity for the best of everything that the 
  USA has to offer. I'm definitely thinking food and drink rather than sports... New Haven apizza, burgers, 
  incredible mexican food, chicken wings drenched in hot sauce, real bbq, delicious IPAs etc.
  
  Academics

Before I turned to performance professionally I spent a number of years
 pursuing music academically and am still hugely passionate about it. I count Martin Ennis,
  Nicholas Marston, James Hepokoski and Daniel Harrison as my most formative mentors and collaborators.
   I continue to engage with the academia through my teaching in Yale College which provides its own challenges.
