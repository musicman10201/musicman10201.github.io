<h3>ACADEMICS</h3>
</div>

Before I turned to performance professionally I spent a number of years
pursuing music academically and am still hugely passionate about it. I count Martin Ennis,
Nicholas Marston, James Hepokoski and Daniel Harrison as my most formative mentors and teachers.
I continue to engage with the academia through a variety of teaching work.
