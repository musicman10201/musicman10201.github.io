<h3>PERSONAL</h3>
</div>

When I'm not teaching, playing and conducting, I am a keen sportsman and enjoy playing badminton 
competitively as well as more occasional forays onto the squash and tennis courts. I also excel as an 
armchair fan of most sports, knowing far more than I should about the obscurities of darts, snooker, 
tennis, football (soccer) and athletics. The flipside of my sporting endeavors is a passion for eating and drinking, and general Yorkshire pride. My time in America has left me with a particular affinity for the best of everything that the 
  USA has to offer. I'm definitely thinking food and drink rather than sports... New Haven apizza, burgers, 
  incredible mexican food, chicken wings drenched in hot sauce, real bbq, delicious IPAs etc.

<h3>ACADEMICS</h3>
</div>

Before I turned to performance professionally I spent a number of years
pursuing music academically and am still hugely passionate about it. I count Martin Ennis,
Nicholas Marston, James Hepokoski and Daniel Harrison as my most formative mentors and teachers.
I continue to engage with the academia through a variety of teaching work.
