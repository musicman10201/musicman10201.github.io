I am a conductor and pianist currently hold the HR Taylor Trust Scholarship in conducting at the Royal College
of Music with Peter Stark and Howard Williams. Just as happy in front of choir as orchestra, I have had the
opportunity to conduct across with the UK and America with student orchestras and choirs including the Cambridge
University Symphony Orchestra, Clare College Choir, St. Andrew's Chamber Orchestra, Wesleyan College Orchestra,
Yale Philharmonia and the Yale Schola Cantorum.


I hold degrees in Musicology from Cambridge and Music Theory from Yale University where I was supported by a
Mellon Fellowship and enjoyed teaching undergraduate courses in harmony, counterpoint, keyboard and hearing.
For the past two years I served as music director at the University Church at Yale and the Saybrook College Orchestra,
with whom I led an outreach program of educational concerts.


A the Royal College I am looking forward to conducting the RCM Philharmonic, premiering new works
with the RCM New Ensemble and assisting on opera projects. When I am not conducting, I am a keen pianist,
singer and educator and am always looking for opportunities to combine these interests!
